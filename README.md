# Bright Futures Generator v2.0

A random futures generating tool for inspiration and provocation. 

It matches a sector or a concept with a technology to claim that technology will be the reason for a better future for that aspect of our lives. It's also capable of generating explanations for the random combinations and images to share around (or to add your presentations) using Gemini.
